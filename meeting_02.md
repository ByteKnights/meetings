## I) We need a bloody idea
In our last meeting, Devin came up with three useful parameters that will judge our ideas. The idea that demonstrates these three traits the best will become our project.

* **Original**

* **Cool (WOW Factor)**

* **Challenging yet Realistic**

***and Particle nut***

Therefore, for every idea that is mentioned, will rate based on these three traits. You guys got really creative in the last meeting and on the discord. Below is a compilation of all our ideas.

* Procedural Modeling Algorithm: Random world generator.

* IoT Rover: Self driving car network, Mapping system, AI.

* Hardware Immersive Gaming

* AI Related: TensorFlow

* Thermo Acoustic generator

* Moving Plant

We need more ideas, so here are some community projects to help you get started.

* There are many maker projects out there that utilize hardware and software. Some are really cool, some are extremely useful, some are just outright useless.

* [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/customerprojects/)

* [Hexapod Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9TnLmJGbs)

* [Rubik's Cube Solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNhQUrkPYJs)

* [Floppies are Still Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB6IKDA4Ovs)

* [Your RA may scold you for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPQFeMdPJiA)

So with all of our ideas, I recommend that we use this table template below to rank the ideas and get the sum of each score.
