## III) Lets talk about HackWITUs.
![HackWITUs Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackwitus/hackwit.us/master/src/assets/images/logo1.png)
* __Hackathon__: A project competition where interdisciplinary teams create a project and       finish it within a short amount of time *(HackWITUs: 24Hrs)*

* HackWITUs is Wentworth's official hackathon that takes place in __Ira Allen__ during the weekend.

* Free Food!


## IV) The "Electric" in Electric Hat: Crash Course on Hardware / Software?

* While most hackathons are programming oriented, you are allowed to use electronics / hardware in your project.

* If you haven't guessed already, were doing an electronics project because "why not?!".

### Part A) The Hardware / Electronics 101

> *Note: many parts listed below can be found on websites such as Adafruit and Amazon.*

* __ Basic concepts:__ voltage, resistance, current, power, analog, digital.

* __Basic components:__ resistors, capacitors, LEDs, diodes, transistors, IC's, and much more.

* __Tools and Accessories:__ power supplies, breadboards, jumper-wire, multi-meters, oscilloscopes, etc.

* __Sensors:__ switches, photo-resistors, temperature and humidity sensors, raindrop sensors, proximity sensors, accelerometers, GPS, transceivers, laser detectors, etc.

* __Electromechanical:__ DC motors, servos, stepper motors, 3D printed parts.

* __Development Boards:__ Arduinos, FPGAs, Raspberry Pi's, Particle boards and accessories.

### Part B) IoT and Particle 101 (With Nate)

[FILL IN THIS SECTION NATE, ALSO TALK ABOUT PROGRAMMING IN GENERAL]

### Part C) Take inspiration from projects
* There are many maker projects out there that utilize hardware and software. Some are really cool, some are extremely useful, some are just outright useless.

* [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/customerprojects/)

* [Hexapod Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9TnLmJGbs)

* [Rubik's Cube Solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNhQUrkPYJs)

* [Floppies are Still Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB6IKDA4Ovs)

* [Your RA may scold you for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPQFeMdPJiA)

* [FEEL FREE TO ADD MORE TO THE LIST]

## VI) Getting the Right Tools

* GitHub Account [COVER HOW TO USE]

* Atom IDE

* [LINUX?]

* [NATE, FILL IN OTHER SOFTWARE WE MAY NEED]

## VII) Moving Forward and Planning Scope
* In order to be prepared, we must understand how to collaborate effectively.

* [SPECIFY GOALS]

* [SPECIFY MEETINGS REQUIRED]

* [PLAN MEETING TIMES]

* Make sure you register for the hackathon and join our GitHub organization.
