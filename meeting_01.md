## III) Lets talk about HackWITUs.
![HackWITUs Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackwitus/hackwit.us/master/src/assets/images/logo1.png)
* __Hackathon__: A project competition where interdisciplinary teams create a project and       finish it within a short amount of time *(HackWITUs: 24Hrs)*

* HackWITUs is Wentworth's official hackathon that takes place in __Ira Allen__ during the weekend.

* Free Food!


## IV) The "Electric" in Electric Hat: Crash Course on Hardware / Software?

* While most hackathons are programming oriented, you are allowed to use electronics / hardware in your project.

* If you haven't guessed already, were doing an electronics project because "why not?!".

### Part A) The Hardware / Electronics 101

> *Note: many parts listed below can be found on websites such as Adafruit and Amazon.*

* __ Basic concepts:__ voltage, resistance, current, power, analog, digital.

* __Basic components:__ resistors, capacitors, LEDs, diodes, transistors, IC's, and much more.

* __Tools and Accessories:__ power supplies, breadboards, jumper-wire, multi-meters, oscilloscopes, etc.

* __Sensors:__ switches, photo-resistors, temperature and humidity sensors, raindrop sensors, proximity sensors, accelerometers, GPS, transceivers, laser detectors, etc.

* __Electromechanical:__ DC motors, servos, stepper motors, 3D printed parts.

* __Development Boards:__ Arduinos, FPGAs, Raspberry Pi's, Particle boards and accessories.

### Part B) IoT and Particle 101 (With Nate)

[FILL IN THIS SECTION NATE, ALSO TALK ABOUT PROGRAMMING IN GENERAL]

### Part C) Take inspiration from projects
* There are many maker projects out there that utilize hardware and software. Some are really cool, some are extremely useful, some are just outright useless.

* [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/customerprojects/)

* [Hexapod Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9TnLmJGbs)

* [Rubik's Cube Solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNhQUrkPYJs)

* [Floppies are Still Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB6IKDA4Ovs)

* [Your RA may scold you for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPQFeMdPJiA)

* [FEEL FREE TO ADD MORE TO THE LIST]

## VI) Getting the Right Tools

* A good team has good tools. To improve efficiency during the hackathon, we should go over different methods will use to collaborate on work.

### Part α) Git and GitHub
* The best way to collaborate code within a project is to use GitHub which is a version control system.

* **Important: Make sure that you have a GitHub account and [join our
 organization](https://GitHub.com/UntitledHackathonTeam).**

### Part β) Atom Ide

* __Atom__ is a very powerful, multi-purpose IDE that is fully customizable.

* With atom, we can add packages that allow us to use GitHub, Real-time Collab, Compile, and more.

* [Click this link](https://atom.io/) to download Atom

### Optional) Linux Subsystem or Dual-boot.

* __Linux__ is an advanced and developer friendly family of operating systems that are open-source.

* Most distros are free of charge and usually easy to install.

* Windows 10 comes with a feature that allows you to emulate the Linux terminal called "Linux Subsystem"

* Or you can go full Linux and set-up a dual boot.

* Either way, we are happy to help you set up your favorite flavor (Mint) of Linux on your computer.

* Just make sure to install po-util or else Nate will cry.

## VII) Moving Forward and Planning Scope
* In order to be prepared, we must understand how to collaborate effectively.

* **Specify Goals:**

~~~
  To come up with idea ASAP. Also to plan out our idea ahead of time and collaboration skills necessary.
~~~

* **Specify Meeting Times:**

* Make sure you register for the hackathon and join our GitHub organization.
